# kivy_to_apk

Hello friends,
  I have made Pong Game in Kivy and I have search to conversion to apk but it take me up to 3 days to figure out how to convert it into apk.
  Because there are different method of conversion available. I have tried all methods separately and in each method there are some errors comes for me.
  I am not telling that all methods are wrong for some people it might work. But I have seen in each method some people are facing some problem.
  
  Now I Have concluded a method best of over the other methods. I think it will work for all kivy files.
  
  You just need to do that download doc file which I have been shared and follow all given steps one by one.
  
  For the first time it may take a long time but after you convert one file than from 2nd file it doesn’t take that much of time
  
  Because here I am using a virtual environment in virtual box which is very much safe for your pc and doesn’t affect the other system of your pc

From 2nd time:
	You just upload your kivy folder in environment folder and in terminal with current directory your kivy folder just run “buildozer init” command which create “buildozer.spec” file and then edit it as per your requirement and update using command in terminal ”sudo apt update”
And then run the last command “buildozer -v android debug”. And Congratulation your apk file is created in bin folder inside your kivy folder

  
  Thankyou
